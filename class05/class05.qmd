# Plotting in R

R has multiple plotting and graphics systems. The most popular of which is **ggplot2**. 

We have already played with "base" R graphics. This comes along with R "out of the box".

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Compared to base R plots ggplot is much more verbose - I need to write more code to get simple plots like the above.

To use ggplot I need to first install the ggplot2 package. To install any package in R I use the `install.packages()` command along with the package name.

The install is a one time only requirement. The package is now on our computer. I don't need to re-install it. 

However, I can't just use it without leading it up with a `library()` call. 


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot()
```

All ggplot figures need at least 3 things:

-data (this is the data.frame with our numbers)
-aesthetics ("aes", how our data maps to the plot)
-geoms (do want lines, points, columns, etc...)

```{r}
ggplot(data=cars) +
 aes(x=speed, y=dist) + geom_point() 
```

I want a trend line to show the relationship between speed and stopping distance...
```{r}
ggplot(data=cars) +
 aes(x=speed, y=dist) + geom_point() + geom_line()
```

That is not what we want

```{r}
ggplot(data=cars) +
 aes(x=speed, y=dist) + geom_point() +geom_smooth() 
```
```{r}
bb <- ggplot( data=cars) + aes(x=speed, y=dist) + geom_point()

bb
```


```{r}
bb + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE)
```




# Gene expression example

Read the dataset from online
```{r}
url <-"https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_S20/class-material/up_down_expression.txt"
genes <- read.delim(url)
head(genes, 10)
```

```{r}
head(genes)
```

```{r}
nrow(genes)
```
```{r}
colnames(genes)
```

```{r}
table(genes$State)
```
```{r}
ggplot(genes) + aes(Condition1, Condition2, color=State) + geom_point() + 
  labs(title= "Some Plot", subtitle="With a subtitle")
```

I write some text I want **bold** or *italic*

```{r}
p <- ggplot(genes) + 
    aes(x=Condition1, y=Condition2, col=State) +
    geom_point()
p
```

```{r}
p + scale_colour_manual( values=c("blue","gray","red") )
```

```{r}
p + scale_colour_manual(values=c("blue","gray","red")) +
    labs(title="Gene Expresion Changes Upon Drug Treatment",
         x="Control (no drug) ",
         y="Drug Treatment")
```
